# Tunk

An Elixir app for forwarding Google Cloud Platform build statuses to Slack and Github. 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tunk` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tunk, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

The web server runs on port 4000, which can be swapped out in the Dockerfile.

Both integrations are options. In `lib/tunk/config`, enable integrations by setting the `enabled` field to `true`: 

```
# lib/tunk/config.ex

slack: %{
	token: nil, 
	channel: nil, 
	enabled: true	
}
```

There are some env variables that need to get set properly:

|name|description|
|--- |---|
GITHUB_AUTH|Set up a [access_token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) and enable `commit statuses`
GITHUB_USER|The github user who owns the given repo. For example if the repo was `https://github.com/ironbay/tunk`, this would be the string "ironbay"|
SLACK_CHANNEL|The name of the slack channel to post statuses, in the format `#mychannel`. 
SLACK_TOKEN|Set up a [new bot user integration](https://slack.com/signin?redir=%2Fservices%2Fnew%2Fbot) to get a user token.

You can add your own integrations easily. Add them in the same format as slack and github in `lib/tunk/config.ex`. Then 
name your module accoding to the config (i.e. if you add `new` to your config, create a `Tunk.New` module inside of lib. 
To trigger the new module on status updates, update `enabled` to check for the update config (and don't forget to set 
`enabled:true` in the new config.
